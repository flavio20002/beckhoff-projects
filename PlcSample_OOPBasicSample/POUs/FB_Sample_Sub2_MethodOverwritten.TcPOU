   Description:
   This FB extends the base class "FB_Sample_Base". It inherits the basic implementations from the base class.
   In addition, this FB could contain further, additional variable declarations and methods/properties.

   The method "Calculate" of the base class is OVERWRITTEN in this sub class, as the method is explicitly added to this FB
   and as the base implementation of the method is NOT called via SUPER pointer.
		
   Therefore, when calling the method "Calculate" for an instance of this sub class,
   a (maybe completely) different implementation is called - than if calling the method for an instance of the base class.

(* 
- FB_Sample_Sub1_MethodNotChanged:
		The method "Calculate" of the base class is USED WITHOUT ANY CHANGE in this sub class,
		as the method is NOT explicitly added to this FB.
		
		Therefore, when calling the method "Calculate" for an instance of this sub class,
		the basic implementations, that are defined in the base class, are executed for the instance of this sub class.

- FB_Sample_Sub2_MethodOverwritten:
		The method "Calculate" of the base class is OVERWRITTEN in this sub class,
		as the method is explicitly added to this FB
		and as the base implementation of the method is NOT called via SUPER pointer.
		
		Therefore, when calling the method "Calculate" for an instance of this sub class,
		a (maybe completely) different implementation is called - than if calling the method for an instance of the base class. 

- FB_Sample_Sub3_MethodExtended:
		The method "Calculate" of the base class is EXTENDED in this sub class,
		as the method is explicitly added to this FB
		and as the base implementation of the method is called via SUPER pointer (SUPER^.Calculate(...)).
		
		Therefore, when calling the method "Calculate" for an instance of this sub class,
		the basic implementations, that are defined in the base class, are executed for the instance of this sub class (due to the SUPER call)
		and additionally, the further statements are executed for this instance.
